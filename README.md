## Introduction

Documenting data pipelines is hard. Not only is it complex, but it's also time consuming. When working with big teams it becomes near impossible; documentation becomes out of date as soon as it's completed as there's continuous change. **flowsql** hopes to remedy this by allowing you to generate flow diagrams programatically. This allows for reproducable, clear diagrams, which are built with [diagrams.net](diagrams.net) so are also easily shared and edited.


## Features

A few of the things you can do with flowsql:

* Generate flow diagrams from `.sql` files


## Example

1. Starting with a standard `.sql` file, the first step would be then be to run the module on the command line:

    <p align="center">
    <img src = "images/example-sql.png" width=300>
    </p>

    <p align="center">
    <img src = "images/example-terminal.png" width=300>
    </p>

1. After running the command a GUI window will appear. At this stage enter the path of your `.sql` file. When ready, hit the `Run` button!

    </p>

1. The program will then analyse the SQL code and generate a [diagrams.net](diagrams.net) diagram. It will save this file in the `./output/` folder and also try and open it (although this requires a local version of `draw.io` to be installed).
