## Introduction

Documenting data pipelines is hard. Not only is it complex, but it's also time consuming. When working with big teams it becomes near impossible; documentation is out of date as soon as it's completed as there's continual change. **sqlinks** hopes to remedy this by allowing you to generate flow diagrams programatically. This allows for reproducable and clear diagrams that, by using [diagrams.net](diagrams.net), are also easily accessible by non-technical users.


## Features

- üëç Generate flow diagrams from simple CTAS statements
- üëç Visualise interactions of schemas, tables & columns

To come...
- ‚è≥ Functionality for complex CTAS statements, CTEs, INSERT statements etc.
- ‚è≥ Customisation via config files


## Example

Coming soon...

## Getting started

Install **sqlinks** using **pip**:

```pip install sqlinks```


When installed, run **sqlinks** against your current directory using the following:

```python -m sqlinks```

To view all available command line options use:

```python -m sqlinks --help```
